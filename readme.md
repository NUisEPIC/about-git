## The Git cheat sheet for *you*!
##### But in Soviet Russia, YOU cheat on GIT!

## SECTION 1
### Don't be a basic clone

Do you know what SSH is?

It stands for secure-shell, and here's a helpful definition:

> SSH IS THE ONLY WAY TO DO NETWORKING
> â€“ Abraham Lincoln

Here's how some people will tell you to use git:

```bash

~ $ git clone https://github.com/NUisEPIC/epic-site-redesign.git

```

And those people are **wrong**. Don't listen to them, because
they are n00bs and they use HTTP. You don't wanna be a noob. You
gonna use SSH.

```bash

~ $ echo This is how you clone like a pro
This is how you clone like a pro

~ $ git clone git@github.com:NUisEPIC/epic-site-redesign

```

So why is SSH superior?

Because:

* It's encrypted by a private/public keypair that *you* control
  * Unlike a password, which -- although you came up with it! -- it's someone else's
    job to make sure it doesn't get stolen!
  * Sub-lesson: don't trust other people to store your identity!
* You can SSH into all the things
* You don't have to enter a password anymore
* You don't have to *remember* a password anymore
* You'll be one of the cool kids
  * Listen to Abe Lincoln
    * Honest Abe can't tell a lie

## SECTION 1.1
### How to set up SSH, combat evil, and impress that nerdy girl in your CS class

Setting up ssh is easy, assuming you're using a Unix-based computer. (OS X counts. Although
it is inferior to Ubuntu and other Linux distros. </judgment>)

```bash

~ $ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "This is a comment about my SSH key, if I want one."

```

Let's break that down.

`-t rsa`: What type of encryption? We use RSA, because it's a strong, well-tested standard.

**NOTE**: DON'T TRY OUT THE OTHER ENCRYPTION OPTIONS. Many of them have security flaws, like DES.

`-b 4096`: How many bytes of security do we want? The trick here is picking a big
           number that isn't too cumbersome. We have to send this key in all our ssh requests,
           after all, so we don't want it to be too big. (In fact, TCP limits the size a payload
           can have, so there's a hard limit on how big you can make your SSH key.) In general,
           bigger is better. 4096 bytes is a pretty popular choice, and it's big enough to be secure.
           Now, that's only 4kb, but you'll be sending this around a lot, so again, size is of the essence.

Now ssh-keygen will ask you some questions, and you can accept the default answers.

You'll now have a folder called `.ssh` in your home directory, or User folder, depending on your OS.
Inside of that folder will be **TWO** SSH keys: the public key (id_rsa.pub) and the private key
(id_rsa). NEVER NEVER NEVER give ANYONE your PRIVATE KEY. EVER. If you do, you're giving away the
"secret" that only you are supposed to know. Think of your private key as if it's the pad of your
index finger. Would you cut off the pad of your index finger and give it to your friend so that
they could get into your iPhone? No. That's gross. Don't cut off your fingers. Don't give away
your private SSH keys.

Now, the last step: log into GitHub and upload your public key (the id_rsa.pub) to your account
under the "SSH Keys" tab in your user settings. You'll have to copy/paste the file into GitHub.

BAM! You just kicked it up a notch!

## SECTION 2
### Git-ting closer

Now let's actually talk about Git.

#### Git lets you time travel through infinite universes.

Branches and projects are "universes," and advanced git commands like `rebase` and `commit --amend` will allow you to travel through time.

Every git project has three "zones"

Here's a quick reference of most basic Git commands, with descriptions:

| Command                              | Arguments                                           | Explanation                                                                                                                                                         |
